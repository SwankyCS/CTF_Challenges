<b>CTF Challenge Link:</b> https://tryhackme.com/room/ninjaskills </br>
<b>Skill level:</b> beginner </br>
<b>My experience:</b> At first glance this challenge seemed simple enough. I was provided a list of files on the target system and was required to answer questions based on these files. 
It was easy enough to locate each file using simple 'find' commands; from here, answering some of the questions seemed simple enough too (although I did get caught out on a couple of questions). I decided to challenge myself a little more by using bash scripts to complete the challenge.
I have a basic level understanding of scripting; I knew what I wanted to do, but couldn't get the syntax quite right....so I employed the helping hand of ChatGPT to create a foundation and correct some issues along the way.</br></br>

To see how I approached this CTF with some running commentary, please refer to the 'Ninja Skills' file.
